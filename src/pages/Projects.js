        Citation is an episodic mobile and desktop web game made in the amazing
        open-source Godot Game Engine. You play as a fledgling, if not forgetful
        scholar of magic on a hunt for your lost notes. In the process, youâ€™ll
        absorb some common-sense knowledge about what it means to be an ethical
        scholar. This is our first full game as a studio and we all learned a
        lot about what it takes to make a performant, interesting and
        educational web game.
        <br />
        Done in collaboration with NYU.

        Restoration follows the elderly Martin the Fox. He has received an
        eviction notice in the mail, so he attempts to get to the top of a
        multi-purpose office building and speak with the CEO. He is a very
        sentimental father, as he keeps all of his sacred memories in his
        scrapbook. The power of reliving his memories will soon come into play
        as he sneaks past security and knocks out baddies. An old man getting
        violent? Not exactly. A dungeon crawler, with all original assets.
