        Game developed during <i>NYU Game Design 2023</i> focusing on game
        characteristics, namely following the concepts of (Dexterity vs
        Strategy), (Gameplay Heuristics), (Scaling Difficulty & Mastery). This
        game is designed with several heuristics in mind, with a exceedingly
        simple mechanic that still provides challenge and allows for player
        mastery.
        <br />
        <br />
        Built in Godot, assets by Me.

        Aseprite, the pixel art focused art / animation software, has the
        ability to run custom scripts that can change how the software does most
        functions including exports, reading images, layering. etc.
        <br />
        After encountering a problem with scaling, the interpolation resulted in
        messy alpha artifacting, I decided to write my own script that read
        through the image and cleaned up the interpolation alpha artifacts.

        During <i>Interactive Computer Graphics</i>, after completing projects
        implementing techniques such as model generation, model reading, texture
        UV mapping, render to texture, and deferred shading. This project was
        meant to be a free-range application and exploration of advanced
        graphics techniques.
        <br />
        Initially inspired by rolling hills and fireflies, the project
        transformed to the starry landscape that we see now. Procedrually
        generated noise terrain, with randomly instanced snow / star objects

        Implemented with applications of blinn-phong's illumination, flat

        absorb some common-sense knowledge about what it means to be an ethical
        scholar. This is our first full game as a studio and we all learned a
        lot about what it takes to make a performant, interesting and
        educational web game.
